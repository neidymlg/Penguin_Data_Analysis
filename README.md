# Penguin_Data_Analysis
This is mostly a data analysis project that uses T-test and ANOVA tests for three types of penguins. Our first step is to check if our data is normally distributed before doing the tests. We also do the Welsh ANOVA test and transform the skew of the data. After, we use a linear regression model to predict new values for flipper length.
